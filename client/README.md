# Client Side 
Client Side is the code that is executed in web browsers in order to implement interaction with users through graphical interfaces, generally uses framweworks and libraries such as [Angular](https://angular.io/docs), [React](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/), etc.

## Angular
Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:

- A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
- A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more.
- A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code

With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with a minimum of effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.

See the [live example](https://angular.io/generated/live-examples/what-is-angular/stackblitz.html) / [download example](https://angular.io/generated/zips/what-is-angular/what-is-angular.zip) for a working example containing the code snippets in this guide.

## React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on our homepage or [in the tutorial](https://en.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.
